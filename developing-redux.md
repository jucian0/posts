# Developing redux

If you are a software developer and aren't in another world you probably read or hear something about redux, redux today is very popular but not so popular then some years ago, the first time that I hear about React the second word was always redux, "How to init with react and redux", "Todo app with react redux" and another hundred names. Even redux is not so popular today as in the past I think it's very helpful that you know how redux works and how you can create a simple version of this famous pattern.

Redux is a pattern that provides a way to manage your state application, redux pattern turned very popular when front-end applications turned more complex and when we started to develop applications with many components and this sharing the same state. You can find a lot of libraries that implement this, we have Redux for React and RXJS for Angular.

Since Redux is very popular I hope that you know how it works and how to use it, I will provide some basic descriptions about it, but if you want to know more about I recommend that you read the documentation about the patterns and how some libraries implement it.

## Redux anatomy

 - Actions - you can understand actions basically like instructions that drive your intentions, you need a `type` that describes what you want to do, and if your need some data to perform your intentions it's necessary to provide a `payload`.

    ```typescript
    const action = {
        type:'ADD_TODO',
        payload: {label:'Push up', complete:false}
    } 
    ```
- Reducers - reducers are pure functions that perform your intentions in state application, that function receives the current state and the action, that is running. For every action, you should provide a reaction in your reducer.

    ```typescript
    function reducer(state, action){
        switch(action.type){
            case  'ADD_TODO': // do something
            case  'DELETE_TODO': // do another thing
        }
    }
    ```
- Store - I link to think about Store as a place where you have the real state, and it provides the resource to get the state `store.getState()`, and register listeners.

## Your Redux API

This is how we will initiate your Store.

```typescript
const store = new Store(reducers, initialState)
```

Your redux implementation has some public methods and private method:

  - dispatch() - This method will receive the instruction that will drive how the state will be changed.
  - subscriber() - With this method, we can subscribe listeners to know when the application state is changed, these listeners will be simple functions that can receive the new state changed by argument.
  - getValue() - These methods will return the current state of the application.

```typescript
class Store{
    constructor(){}

    dispatch()

    subscriber()
}
```

We need another method to perform the state changes, `reducer` is the last m√©thod that we need in your implementation.

```typescript
class Store{
    //...
    private reduce()
}
```

Okay, we need more than methods in your redux implementation, we need a property to hold the state application, `state` and another to hold the reducers application.

```typescript
class Store{
    private state:{[key:string]:any}
    private reducers:{[key:string]:Function}
    private subscribers: Array<Function>;

    //...
}
```

## Implementation

### Constructor
Let's go ahead, you noticed that I'm using typescript, fell free to use javascript, your first step is to write the constructor method, `constructor` need to receive the reducers and the initialState, let's do that:

```typescript
class Store{
    //...
    constructor(reducers={}, initialState={}){
        this.reducers = reducers
        this.state = initialState
    }
    //...
}
```

Here we are assign `reducers` and `initialState` to `state` and `reducers` properties.

Using it:

```typescript
    const reducers = {
        todoReducer:(state, action) => ({...})
    }

    const initialState = {
        todoReducer:{todos:[]}
    }

    const store = new Store(reducers, initialState)
```

### Reduce
As I told some paragraphs ago, reduce will perform and return the state changed.

```typescript
class Store{
    //...
    private reduce(state, action) {
        const newState = {}
        for (const prop in this.reducers) {
        newState[prop] = this.reducers[prop](state[prop], action)
        }
        return newState
    }
}
```

Here we are iterate reducers registered in Store and invoking every reducer passing by argument the current state and the current action, after that, we save the result returned by every reducer in the correct state property. Finally, we return the new state. Since the reduce method is a private method it will not available to use out.

## Subscribe
Subscribe will allow us to have many state change listeners, let's implement it.

```typescript
class Store{
    //...
    subscribe(fn:Function){
        this.subscribers = [...this.subscribers, fn];

        return () => {
            thi.subscribers = this.subscribers.filter(subscriber => subscriber !== fn)
        }
    }
}
```

Here we received a function that will be invoked when some changes happen in the state, `subscriber` will add the `fn` argument into `subscribers` property. The last part of this method will return another function that when invoked will remove the `fn` function passed by argument. The function that will be returned knows the `subscriber` method context, for this reason, we can compare `fn` argument with every subscriber registered in our Store and decide who needs are removed.

Using it:

```typescript
    //...
    const store = new Store(reducers, initialState)

    function callback(state){
        // do something
    }

    const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(callback)

    unsubscribe()// wii remove callback function
```


### Dispatch

Let's implement this method and learn how it works.

```typescript
class Store{
    //...
    dispatch(action) {
        this.state = this.reduce(this.state, action)
        this.subscribers.forEach(fn => fn(this.state))
    }
}
```

When `reduce` method is invoked it returns a new state and assign it to `state` property of the store, after that, we iterate `subscribers` property and invoking every subscribed function passing the new state by argument, this way every listener will be notified with the new application state.

Using it:

```typescript
//...
const store = new Store(reducers, initialState)

const action = {
    type:'ADD_TODO',
    payload: {label:'Push up', complete:false}
} 

store.dispatch(action)
```

## Final code

```typescript
class Store {
  private subscribers: Function[]
  private reducers: { [key: string]: Function }
  private state: { [key: string]: any }

  constructor(reducers = {}, initialState = {}) {
    this.subscribers = []
    this.reducers = reducers
    this.state = this.reduce(initialState, {})
  }

  get value() {
    return this.state;
  }

  subscribe(fn) {
    this.subscribers = [...this.subscribers, fn]
    fn(this.value)
    return () => {
      this.subscribers = this.subscribers.filter(sub => sub !== fn)
    }
  }

  dispatch(action) {
    this.state = this.reduce(this.state, action)
    this.subscribers.forEach(fn => fn(this.value))
  }

  private reduce(state, action) {
    const newState = {}
    for (const prop in this.reducers) {
      newState[prop] = this.reducers[prop](state[prop], action)
    }
    return newState
  }
}

```

Finally, we have a simple implementation of redux, this implementation does not reflect any redux library implementation, it's just a possible implementation of redux. The principal goal of this post is to show you the simple way how redux works. If you are more interested in a functional approach let me know and we can do it in the next post.

I hope that you enjoyed this post. Stay Safe!!!
