Do you need a form library to build forms in React?
Hello friends, today I will talk with you about forms in React, and tell you how was my first experience building form in React.

My relation with React when was about forms was a love-hate relationship, and this happens because react doesn't say you how everything should works, other reason was because Angular has a powerful solution to build forms(Yeah I've worked with Angular before), and honestly I never found anything so good than reactive forms in React ecosystem.

But everything is changed when React team introduced Hooks API, after that the process to create form become very simple, after that I started to thinks if was really necessary to use a form library to implement forms in React.
