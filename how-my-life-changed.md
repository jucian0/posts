# How simple things changed my life.

I was born in Paraguay, a small country close to Brazil, my parents worked for a long time as farmers, and when I was eight years I started as a farmer worker too, we were planting cotton, and everything was going well, but our luck was going to change.
When you work planting cotton, it's necessary a certain quantity of rain, but if you have a lot of rain, you can lose everything.
So, the rain did not stop for several months, and we lost everything, we were devastated.

## How one question changed my life.
That was when my father found me crying in the middle of the cotton field, he asked me; 
Why are you crying?
And I answered him;
What are we doing here? We lost everything.

So, something happened in my dad's mind, and after we lose everything my parents decided to move to Brazil.
Arriving in Brazil, my parents started to work and I and my siblings had an opportunity to study.
After some years our lives enhanced, but in my mind, and in my parent's minds, school, college was just optional thing, it's easier to change your financial condition than change your mind. Before starting to work as a software developer I worked as a manual laborer, topography, metallurgy professional for ten years.

## How a blog changed my life
Since I always liked computers and I have a great curiosity about how things work, I decided to start a blog about technology, computers, and other topics.

## How my wife changed my life.
I always liked computers and maths, but I never thought that I could work with these things as a professional.

Maybe the title of this publication should be "How my life changed after I meet my wife", she told me that I should continue my study, and start to do what I like to do, so I decided to go to college and try to work as a software developer.

## How college changed my life
Before college, I never thought that I could work with IT, that was a hobby for me, and I was happy with that condition, but there was a lot of o changes since then, besides learning many things college makes me a few more confident about myself, I realize that there are no differences between me and other people, I could do what I want to do.

## How starting to work as a software developer changed my life
Even after I reach my goal to start working as a software developer, there were many kinds of stuff that I realized that I should change in my life, the most important one was, how I see the world, the people, and how can I deal with all them.

Being able to live with different people and cultures changed me, and makes me more human.
I had the opportunity to work and learn with awesome people every day, some of them were not so awesome, but I could learn almost one thing with every one of them.

## Conclusion
I've learned that changing your mind is harder than changing your financial situation, so the most important thing that you can do for yourself is; to improve yourself as a human, open your mind, be a kind person.

Another lesson that I learned was, "do your best",  "trust people", I could not change my life if I did not trust people. If you don't know something, don't hesitate to ask, people can help you, but they need to know that you need help.

My life changed when I realized that I need to do more than the default, I remember when I was donning college, I had many doubts about a specific topic, and I decided to ask my professor about this, he answered me; "I have 10 minutes from here to university park", in old time I never would do it, but I was decided to do, so I used this 10 minutes do ask all my questions.

If you want to go where others don't go, do what others don't do.
